**CloudDealHunt** is a tool designed to help developers find the best prices for various cloud resources such as GPUs, CPUs, AI tokens, and other services across multiple cloud providers. Whether you're working with AI workloads, distributed systems, or general compute needs, CloudPriceFinder ensures you get the best price for the resources you need.

## Features

- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Fetch and compare pricing from popular cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more.
- **Resource Comparison**: Compare prices for GPU models (e.g., A100, H100), CPU types, AI tokens, and other cloud services.
- **Real-Time Pricing**: Get the latest pricing for on-demand, spot, and reserved instances.
- **Developer-Focused**: Tailored for developers who need to optimize cloud infrastructure costs for AI, machine learning, and compute-intensive applications.
- **Custom Filters**: Filter results by resource type, region, pricing model, and more to find the best deals that fit your needs.

## Supported Resources

- **GPU**: A100, H100, MI300, and more.
- **CPU**: General-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized CPUs from various cloud providers.
- **AI Tokens**: Fetch pricing for AI token services like OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.
- **Other Cloud Services**: Storage, networking, and other cloud infrastructure services.
